# Course 1 Project 6

This project involved building a Hack Assembler that is capable of assembling Hack Assembly Code into the binary Hack Machine Code representation. It must be capable of resolving custom symbols and labels.

The code for this project used to be maintained in this folder but I rewrote it and incorporated it into the complete [n2t CLI utility](../n2t/README.md) which performs the same operation.
