# Course 2 Project 7

This project involves building a VM Translator that is capable of translating compiled Jack VM code into the Hack Assembly Language.

The code for this project used to be maintained here but I rewrote it and incorporated it into the complete [n2t CLI utility](../n2t/README.md) which performs the same operation.
