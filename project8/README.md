# Course 2 Project 8

This project involved building the complete VM Translator that added the ability to declare and call functions and handle the caller frame.

The code for this project used to be maintained in the project7 folder but I rewrote it and incorporated it into the complete [n2t CLI utility](../n2t/README.md) which performs the same operation.
